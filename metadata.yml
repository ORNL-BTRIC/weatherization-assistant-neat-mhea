description: "The software provides a measure selection technique indicating cost\
  \ effective retrofit activities that can be applied to a home using a standard Savings\
  \ to Investment Ratio (SIR). Users must provide an input file describing the characteristics\
  \ of the home to be evaluated. The software takes the input data provided and calculates\
  \ energy savings and cost savings predicted for a standard set of measures given\
  \ the input parameters. The Weatherization Assistant computes estimates of pre-retrofit\
  \ whole building space heating and cooling energy consumptions based on the house\
  \ description data supplied by the user. The consumptions are computed using a monthly\
  \ heating and cooling variable base degree-day method by algorithms similar to those\
  \ developed for the CIRA program [LBL, 1982]. The building consumptions are needed\
  \ in computing the energy savings from measures affecting the efficiencies of the\
  \ heating and cooling equipment. Weatherization Assistant then computes the energy\
  \ savings and costs for each individual measure applicable to the building described\
  \ as if it were the only measure installed in the house. From these energy savings,\
  \ a discounted dollar savings over the life of each measure is computed. The ratio\
  \ of this dollar savings to the cost of installing the measure, the \"savings-to-investment\
  \ ratio\" (SIR), is used in an initial ranking of the measures' effectiveness. The\
  \ \"interacted\" savings and SIR of measures are then determined assuming the measures\
  \ are added to the house collectively, in order of their ranking, e.g., the second\
  \ ranked measure is installed in the house initially described by the user after\
  \ having been modified by the first ranked measure. If this second-ranked measure's\
  \ updated SIR is greater than a user-defined limit, the measure is left implemented,\
  \ else it is removed so that the next measure's effectiveness is not dependent on\
  \ it. The choice between two mutually exclusive measures (such as different levels\
  \ of insulation) is made on the basis of their \"net present value\" (NPV), the\
  \ difference of life-time savings and installation cost, rather than their SIR.\
  \ This has been shown to be the more correct criterion on which to base the selection\
  \ between two measures, both of which cannot be installed. The audit computes and\
  \ reports to the user the energy savings, discounted dollar savings, installation\
  \ cost, and SIR for each measure considered cost-effective. For those with SIR greater\
  \ than the user-designated cutoff, a materials list gives the material name, type,\
  \ and quantity required for installation of the measure. Weatherization Assistant\
  \ permits entry of pre-retrofit billing data for gas or electrically heated homes\
  \ or homes with electric air-conditioning. The user may then make the decision to\
  \ have the savings of the measures adjusted to reflect the difference in billed\
  \ consumption and that predicted by the program."
