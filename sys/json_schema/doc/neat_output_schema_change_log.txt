v10.0.10 5/22/2020

1) Added "audit_section_id" as a required element to the "measures" array.  This element was already being printed for each "measures" record, but it was not listed as a required element.

2) Added "component_id" to the "measures" array and included in the required list of elements.  This is a string identifier currently only used as a pass through for "itemized_costs" array input records.  It will be a zero length string for all other "measures" array records for now.
